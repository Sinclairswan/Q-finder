#Contributing Process for our team
1) Code will be reviewed before merging branch into master by other members
2) Merge feature branch in to master once feature has been completed and passing tests.
3) Merge the latest master in to feature branch and pass all test before mering into master
4) One branch per feature- do not stack branches with multiple features
